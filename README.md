This is the README.md for COSI103 CPA02

This app is a movie wishlist app. The idea is that users can enter the movies that they want to see or the movies they haven't gotten around to seeing yet
and the app will maintain a list for you. Users can add new movies at any time, and search across the database to find movies in other wishlists 
that they would like to add to their own.
